### Current Implementation:

Files created/edited:

> README.md
> index.html
> cards_wc.js
> cards_functions.js
> styles.css

The `index.html` file allows for our application to render the web component playing cards generated from the `cards_wc.js` file. 
These playing card components will then utilize functions in the `cards_functions.js` such as `shuffle` or `drawCards` to manipulate cards from our instantiated deck. The `styles.css` file is currently empty and contains no styling. All current visuals are generated from
imported images or gifs.

##NOTES:

The playing card components in `cards_wc.js` are WIP and are not implemented yet.
